                            <h4>Manual analysis of ECG signals is laborious and prone-to-error task, 
                                even for specialist with many hours of experience. There are lots of chances when Diagnostic errors of pseudo-arrhythmias
                                 appear to be increasing in frequency
                                For this reason we developed this web app which is fully functional as an expert system 
                                for automatic diagnosis of Heart Realted diseases i.e system a useful support tool for heart diagnosis
                                The term “heart disease” is often used interchangeably with the term “cardiovascular disease”. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart’s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.</h4>
